## Product Backlog

Trello PBI Board: ["Imported Malaria Monitor" Product Backlog](https://trello.com/b/2R8EOqim/imported-malaria-monitor "Imported Malaria Monitor Product Backlog")

### Product Backlog Order Rational

The product backlog is ordered based on a MVP (Minimal Viable Product) criteria and the feature priorities state by the stakeholder.

## Definition of Ready

A Product Backlog Item (PBI) is "ready" for a consideration in a sprint when:

* It has a title
* It has a User Story opening sentence
* It has an estimate in story points
* Its user story identifies its business value
* Its acceptance criteria are clear and testable
* Its details are sufficiently understood by the development team so it can make an informed decision as to whether it can be completed in one sprint
* It is small enough to comfortably be completed in one sprint
* Its clear how the Definition of Done can apply to its completion
* Its dependencies are identified and no external dependencies would block the PBI from being completed (i.e. tool, skills,resources are available)
* The team understands how to demonstrate the PBI at the sprint review


### Relative Size Estimates

Relative size estimates of story board points was done by Planning Poker. It was facilitated by the web tool https://play.planningpoker.com

Only developmental team members participated in creating the estimates.

## Definition of Done
- There are unit tests
- Unit tests are automated
- All unit tests pass
- Design decisions are documented (in-line is Ok)
- Code reviewed, questions/problems are resolved
- No objections from dev team
- Passes all acceptance tests
- Code builds
- Code is committed
- No technical debt
- Stakeholders agree that it's done
