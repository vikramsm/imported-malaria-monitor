### Product Backlog Order Rational

TODO:.. add PBI ordering rational....

## Definition of Ready

A Product Backlog Item (PBI) is "ready" for a consideration in a sprint when:

* It has a title
* It has a User Story openning sentence
* It has an estimate in story points
* Its user story identifies its business value
* Its acceptance criteria are clear and testable
* Its details are sufficiently understood by the development team so it can make an informed decision as to whether it can be completed in one sprint
* It is small enough to comfortably be completed in one sprint
* Its clear how the Definition of Done can apply to its completion
* Its dependencies are identified and no external dependencies would block the PBI from being completed (i.e. tool, skills,resources are available)
* The team understands how to demonstrate the PBI at the sprint review
